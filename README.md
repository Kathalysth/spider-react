## 🎯 Project Overview

Spider is a complete React library implementation following best practice coding standards. This project aims to provide:

- **Fiber Architecture**: Modern reconciliation with time-slicing
- **Concurrent Features**: useTransition, Suspense, and priority-based rendering
- **Complete Hooks System**: All React hooks with custom hooks support
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Streaming SSR with selective hydration
- **TypeScript First**: Fully typed with strict mode
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing and performance optimization

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Completed

- [x] Project setup and tooling configuration
- [ ] Core element and component system
- [ ] Basic reconciliation algorithm
- [ ] DOM renderer implementation
- [ ] Hooks system (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- [ ] Fiber architecture
- [ ] Concurrent rendering
- [ ] Suspense and error boundaries
- [ ] Server-side rendering

## 📦 Packages

Spider is organized as a monorepo with two main packages:

- **`spider`**: Core React implementation
- **`spider-dom`**: DOM renderer for browser environments

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Install both packages
npm install spider spider-dom

# Or with yarn
yarn add spider spider-dom
```

## 📖 Quick Start

```typescript
import { createElement, useState } from 'spider';
import { createRoot } from 'spider-dom';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return createElement('div', {}, [
    createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello Spider!'),
    createElement('p', {}, `Count: ${count}`),
    createElement(
      'button',
      {
        onClick: () => setCount(count + 1),
      },
      'Increment'
    ),
  ]);
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
root.render(createElement(App));
```
